UX Case Study
Introduction
The purpose of this UX case study is to design a website for a web designer who is starting their own business. The website should showcase their skills and abilities as a designer and provide potential clients with a clear understanding of the services they offer.

Research
The first step in designing the website was to conduct research. We researched the latest trends in web design and examined the websites of other web designers to see what worked well and what didn't. We also looked at the target audience for the website, which included small business owners, startups, and entrepreneurs.
Based on our research, we found that the most effective web design websites were those that focused on showcasing the designer's portfolio and skills. This allowed potential clients to get a sense of the designer's style and capabilities.

Design
The design of the website was created with the goal of highlighting the designer's work and expertise. The website was designed with a modern, clean aesthetic that showcased the designer's portfolio and services.

Homepage
The homepage was designed to be clean and easy to navigate. It featured a large hero image with a call-to-action button that directed visitors to the designer's portfolio. The main navigation was located at the top of the page, and it included links to the designer's portfolio, services, and contact information.

Portfolio
The portfolio page can be designed to showcase the designer's work. The page included a grid of images that were clickable, allowing visitors to view the designer's work in more detail. Each image included a brief description of the project, the designer's role, and the skills used.
